create/drop seq in multiple dbs/schemas
0. do below seq generation with both directly a seq, and with implicit seqs created for table columns.
1. given only 1 computing node(CN), multiple connections running multiple seq (which belong to multiple databases and schemas) generations concurrently can produce monotically increasing seq values for each seq.
2. given multiple CNs, multiple connections running multiple seq(which belong to multiple databases and schemas) generations concurrently can produce unique seq values for each seq.
3. crash safety: in above 2 configurations, kill CN or storage shard master randomly repeatedly, above conclusion still true over a long period of time
4. seqs create/drop stmts can replicate to multiple CNs while computing node crashes and/or metadata shard crashes, and #2 can always be true
